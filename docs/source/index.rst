intrinsic: Geometry and topology methods for DL
=======================

This package implements a variety of geometry and topology methods tailored for topological data analysis (TDA). 
It provides tools to compute persistent homology, generate persistence diagrams, and calculate various metrics such as total persisentce, persistence entropy, Betti numbers, Euler characteristics, etc.
as well as calculate intrinsic dimension via different methods and find curvature and magnitude of data representations.

Designed for both researchers and practitioners, this package aims to facilitate the exploration and analysis of the topological structure of data and 
train the models for getting data embeddings regularizing by the values of these properties.
